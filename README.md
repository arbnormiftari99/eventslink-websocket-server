The EventsLink WebSocket Server powers the real-time chat functionality of the EventsLink platform, which is built on top of Next.js. This server is developed using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation for managing WebSocket connections with Socket.IO. It enables seamless, long-lasting real-time communication between attendees and organizers during events.

To ensure reliability and performance, the WebSocket Server and the EventsLink application are hosted on separate providers, optimizing the stability and scalability of real-time interactions. This architecture guarantees consistent, uninterrupted connections across the platform, enhancing the overall user experience.
